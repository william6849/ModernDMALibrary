# MordenDMALibrary
I have a MacBook and a PC running Linux, but I don’t want to reboot my secondary PC whenever I want to use DMA.  
In fact, I don’t want to install multiple operating systems or even get another PC.  
A flexible DMA library is exactly what I need.

If you have any ideas or requests about the DMA library, please tell me by creating an issue on GitHub.
